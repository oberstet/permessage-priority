               Message Priority Extension for WebSocket 
                draft-oberstein-hybi-permessage-priority


Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the WebSocket protocol that
   adds message priorities to WebSocket data messages. Endpoints and
   intermediaries supporting this extension can prioritize the
   transmission of WebSocket messages according to assigned priorities.
   The strict message ordering requirement of WebSocket is relaxed,
   allowing to transmit messages of high priority without blocking of
   transmission when a low priority message is already being sent.

   Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

1  Introduction

   <Introduction Text>

1.1  Conformance Requirements and Complementary Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.  In particular, the algorithms defined in this
   specification are intended to be easy to understand and are not
   intended to be performant.

   This document references the procedure to _Fail the WebSocket
   Connection_. This procedure is defined in Section 7.1.7 of [RFC6455].

   This document references the event that _The WebSocket Connection is
   Established_ and the event that _A WebSocket Message Has Been
   Received_. These events are defined in Section 4.1 and Section 6.2,
   respectively, of [RFC6455].


1.2  Complementary Terminology

   This document defines some terms about WebSocket and WebSocket
   Extension mechanism that are underspecified or not defined at all in
   [RFC6455].  This terminology is effective only in this document and
   any other documents that refer to this section.

   Non-control message means a message that consists of non-control
   frames as defined in Section 5.6 of [RFC6455].

   Message payload (or payload of a message) means concatenation of the
   payload data portion of all frames representing a single message, as
   well as how /data/ is formed from in Section 6.2 of [RFC6455].

   Extension in use next to extension X means the extension listed next
   to X in the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header in the server's opening
   handshake as defined in Section 9.1 of [RFC6455].  Such an extension
   is applied to outgoing data from the application right after X on

   sender side but applied right before X to incoming data from the
   underlying transport.

   Extension negotiation offer means each element in the "Sec-WebSocket-
   Extensions" header in the client's opening handshake.

   Extension negotiation response means each element in the "Sec-
   WebSocket-Extensions" header in the server's opening handshake.

   Accept an extension negotiation offer means including a corresponding
   extension negotiation response in the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions"
   header in the server's opening handshake.

   Decline an extension negotiation offer means not including a
   corresponding extension negotiation response in the "Sec-WebSocket-
   Extensions" header in the server's opening handshake.

3  Extension Negotiation

   To offer use of the permessage-priority extension, a client includes
   a "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header that contains an element with the
   value "permessage-priority" in the client's opening handshake of the
   WebSocket connection.

   There are no parameters to the extension offer.

Internet-Draft      Priority Extension for WebSocket        January 2014


   To accept an offer to use the permessage-priority extension, a server
   includes a "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header that contains an element
   with the value "permessage-priority" in the server's response during
   the opening handshake of the WebSocket connection.

   There are no parameters to the extension acceptance.

   A server MUST NOT accept a permessage-priority extension offer
   together with another extension if the permessage-priority extension
   will conflict with the other extension on use of the RSV2 bit.  A
   client that receives a response accepting a permessage-priority
   extension offer together with such an extension MUST _Fail the
   WebSocket Connection_.

   A server declines a permessage-priority extension offer by not
   sending a "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header or by not including any
   element with the value "permessage-priority" in the "Sec-WebSocket-
   Extensions" header in it's response. If a server responds with no
   "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header or no "permessage-priority" element
   in the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header, both endpoints proceed
   without permessage-priority extension once _the WebSocket Connection
   is established_.

   If a server responds with a "permessage-priority" in the "Sec-
   WebSocket-Extensions" header and _the WebSocket Connection is
   established_, both endpoints MUST use the algorithm described in
   Section 6 to exchange prioritized WebSocket messages.


3.1  Negotiation Examples

   The following are examples for the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header
   in WebSocket opening handshake client requests and server responses-

   Client and server negotiate and agree to use permessage-priority
   extension:

      Offer (client-to-server HTTP request header):

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-priority

      Accept (server-to-client HTTP response header):

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-priority


   Client offers, but server denies to use permessage-priority
   extension:

      Offer (client-to-server HTTP request header):

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-priority

      Deny (server-to-client HTTP response header):

         Sec-WebSocket-Extensions:


4  Framing

   The permessage-priority extension operates only on non-control
   messages. Control messages remain completely unchanged.

   This document allocates the RSV2 bit of the WebSocket header for the
   permessage-priority extension, and calls the bit "Per-message
   Priority". On a WebSocket connection where the permessage-priority
   extension is in use, this bit indicates whether a message is
   prioritized or not.

   A prioritized message has the "Per-message Priority" bit set on the
   first and all subsequent fragments of the message.

   First fragment of a prioritized message:

         0                   1                   2                   3  
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   
    + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +   
    |                       Frame Header (RSV2 set)                 |   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+   
    |                          Message ID                           |   
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+   
    |       Message Priority        |    Response Priority Hint     |   
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+   
    |                         Payload Data                          |   
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+


   Subsequent fragments of a prioritized message:

         0                   1                   2                   3

    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Message ID:   32 bit

      The "Message ID" is interpreted as an unsigned integer in network
      byte order and provides a sender-chosen ID for the prioritized
      message. The ID carries no semantic meaning and is used by the
      receiver to correlate frames that form fragments of a given
      message. The ID 0 MUST NOT be used on prioritized messages.

   Message Priority:  16 bit

      The "Message Priority" is interpreted as an unsigned integer in
      network byte order and provides the desired message priority for
      sending. The value 0 is the highest priority, the value 65535 is
      the lowest priority.

   Response Priority Hint:  16 bit

      The "Response Priority Hint" is interpreted as an unsigned integer
      in network byte order and provides a hint to the receiver for the
      message priority to use when replying to the received message, in
      case the sent message is part of a request/response message
      exchange. The value 0 is the highest priority, the value 65535 is
      the lowest priority.



5  permessage-priority extension

      Upon receiving a non-control frame with the RSV2 bit set:

        1) Read the "Message ID" and determine whether a prioritized
      message with that ID was started  2) If no prioritized message
      with the received ID was started, read and remember "Message
      Priority" and "Response Priority Hint" and process the rest of the
      frame's payload as application data  3) If a prioritized message
      with the received ID was already started, process the rest of the
      frame's payload as application data 

      Upon receiving a non-control frame with the RSV2 bit not set:

        1) Treat the message as if a prioritized message with "Message
      ID" 0, "Message Priority" 0 and "Response Priority Hint" 0 would
      be processed  2) Process the complete frame payload as application
      data

      Upon receiving a non-control frame with the FIN bit set:

        1) Fire the _A WebSocket Message Has Been Received_ event with
      the application payload received for the message with the given
      ID.  2) Mark the message ID as non-started.

6  Security Considerations

      With Per-message Priority Extension active, there can be more than
      one message in flight in each direction, and hence, additional
      buffering might be required on endpoints and intermediaries.

      A rogue implementation or an attacker might use this to mount a
      denial-of-service attack, exhausting memory in the target. For
      example, an attacker might start a large number of prioritized
      messages, but never end them.

      WebSocket endpoints and intermediaries supporting the Per-message
      Priority Extension SHOULD therefor provide means to effectively
      limit the total buffering memory in use on a WebSocket connection,
      and fail the WebSocket connection when that limit is reached.


7  IANA Considerations

7.1  Registration of the "permessage-priority" WebSocket Extension Name

      This section describes a WebSocket extension name registration in
      the WebSocket Extension Name Registry [RFC6455].

      Extension Identifier

      permessage-priority

      Extension Common Name

      WebSocket Per-message Priority

      Extension Definition

      This document.

      Known Incompatible Extensions

      None

      The "permessage-priority" extension name is used in the "Sec-
      WebSocket-Extensions" header in the WebSocket opening handshake to
      negotiate use of the permessage-priority extension.


7.2  Registration of the "Per-message Priority" WebSocket Framing Header
      Bit

Internet-Draft      Priority Extension for WebSocket        January 2014


      This section describes a WebSocket framing header bit registration
      in the WebSocket Framing Header Bits Registry [RFC6455].

      Header Bit

      RSV2

      Common Name

      Per-message Priority

      Meaning

      The message is prioritized or not.

      Reference

      Section X of this document.

      The "Per-message Priority" framing header bit is used on all
      fragments of non-control messages to indicate whether the fragment
      belongs to a prioritized message or not.
